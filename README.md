# Group-Messaging-System
The Group Messaging System is designed to replace messages left with pen and paper, by providing an easy to use system that allows leaving digital text messages to other users in the system, which can then be retrieved and reviewed from the recipient’s GMS inbox. The proposal is accomplished by adding value to an existing PC or laptop. By adding an external interface in the form of a customized button pad, web camera, microphone, speakers and a fingerprint reader (optional – for security) and controlling software, the GMS allows better communication between users of a shared environment.
